3. ENABLE WIFI

Create a file called wpa_supplicant.conf . This is a configuration file that will allow you to pre-configure the WiFi credentials. On boot, the Pi will copy and use this as the default configuration file.

In this file, place the following content:

country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
ssid="WIFI_SSID"
scan_ssid=1
psk="WIFI_PASSWORD"
key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
Please double check and verify the WiFi credentials. If not, the next step will be hard.

4. create a file without extension

tough ssh 		# in ubuntu

5. ssh pi@raspberrypi.local (to find the device)

else use ip scanner to find the ip and type in terminal


ssh pi@192.168.129.44

6. sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
